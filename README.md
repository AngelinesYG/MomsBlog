# Project2
Project name: Mom Blog

I started out not knowing what I wanted to do and after talking to a classmate and thinking of a writing project I had done years ago, I got the idea to create a Mom Blog.

The idea behind this is for moms to freely express how they feel when it comes to their struggles as a mom. No judgment and the option make it anonymously make it appealing and more likely for moms to really express how they feel.

I struggled A LOT the first two and a half days. I kept getting bug after bug and became super frustrated. I felt incompetent and like I was bothering too many people.

The bugs were very weird at first. Something about no engine node, even though it was clearly in the package.json. The error didn't seem to very specific and took hours to figure out. Turned to be a dang coma! a freaking comma where a period should go!

The next crazy error was due to files getting mixed up when I tried to rename my project. (Or at least I think that was the reason). That one also took a very long time to figure out because when clicking a link to the question and answer page, it kept saying there was an error on a different file which was fully functional. It didn't make any sense at all.

When I finally got MVP I worked on CSS a little and making some of the appearance better. I also tried to do a drop down menu on the question and answer page but for some reason all the different methods I tried kept braking my code. Nothing made sense.

The CSS isn't as it should because I was running out of time with all the bugs, including CSS not doing what I was trying to do and having to do a whole lot of trial and error to achieve something.

Finally, with one day left of the project I am left with the choice to attempt authentication. I came into the project knowing that I may not be able to do it, but REALLY wanting to try. It would make my app soooo much better if I could accomplish authentication. The idea would be for users to just see the index page where the list of blogs are displayed but not be able to do anything else unless logged in. Once logged in, they can read all the blogs and create, delete, and/or edit their own blogs, and then I could hopefully turn this into a real app where real moms could sign up and be a part of. Connect with and receive support from other moms.

UPDATE: On the very last day of the project I was able to accomplish authentication. I can't believe I did it. It feels awesome.
If I had more time to dedicate to it there would be better functionality to everything. Like for example, making it so that a user cannot edit/delete/update someone else's blogs. I would also make it nicer in the sense that on the index page there would be something that says "please log in to read all blogs. Or inviting the user to take advantage of this site by creating an account and begginging to write their own blogs as well." Additionally, I would make it so that once the user is signed in, the part where it displays the name and the option to log out is much nicer and displays a message prompting the user to write a new blog or explore the site.

Inspite of everything, I had fun with this project. I was able to be creative and incorporate some of the things I love doing, which is writing. I got some other moms involved by asking them to write a blog for me so that I could put it on the page. And even thought I know the background images are kind of annoying to look at, I thought they were funny and wanted to incorporate them in some way. I tried doing hero images with them, but I was having a lot of trouble moving the forms down to the bottom, so I just ended up giving the forms a plain color background and leaving the images below. One css bug I couldn't fix FOR DAYS was that when the index page that displays all of the blogs is shortened, some of the words and images in the card shrink along with the card, but in on other cards, they spill out. I have no idea why for some it shrinks with and for others it spills out. I couldn't figure that out. And then, as I was sitting here writing this, something I learned when trying to do the drop down menu came to my mind. The overflow property. I tried it on the card and it worked! BUT the top of the titles gets cut off at certain sizes. Also, another thing I wanted to fix but didn't have time was that when you view the index page on a mobile phone the cards look super long and skinny and the images and words in them are very hard to see. Again, I would definitely change and/or improve the background images. This was one of those where I was trying them out and left them there to work on something else thinking I'd have more time to go back and change them. I really wanted funny backgrounds because of the type of site that it is. Because mom's sometimes need a good laugh and to see memes like that. But I didn't expect for the background to be repeated like that and I had a lot of trouble adjusting them. I would also make the edit and new pages better and make the box where they enter the forms bigger. I remember we learned that recently, I just didn't have enough time.

I would've definitely tried making the css better. I happen to like css, but I struggle a lot with figuring out the right properties to use. Sometimes the divs don't do what you expect them to. For example, I had a div around an ul tag but for some reason nothing worked until I put the div on li tags. I also would've maybe added a few more blogs and more functionality to the pages.

This is a project that I would actually like to turn into a real website. Like an outlet for moms to vent and find support.


Things to add as suggeted by Brendan:
1. Related models so that users have their own posts

2. more auth flow (only logged in users or certain users can do certain things like only a mom who posted a certain blog is the only one who can edit that certain blog

3. friends feature
