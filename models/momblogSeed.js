      blog:`Having all boys, while it’s an incredible blessing, it’s also A LOT of work. These kids just won’t’ sit the heck down!!
      I can’t keep up with them. You turn your back for one second and it’s like a damn tornado struck the place.
      Yes, they are super sweet and always wanting to hug you. Words can’t express the love…
      But I’m tired of having to strip naked from the waist down just so I could pee due to the fear of getting up from the toilet and having the bottom of my pants soaked in piss. And that’s not the worse part, I can’t even count how many times I almost busted my ass trying to sit down on the toilet only to notice, at the very last minute, that the seat is bathed in the sticky, stinky, disgusting, yellow liquid. Ugh!

      And not. It doesn’t really get better. The older the messier! I can’t tell you how many times I found nasty, moldy, old, dried-up food on some random place in a plate I had been looking for for days. Sigh…

      But you know what even more insane?! Incomprehensible even. The fear of some hoochie, chicken head coming to take my babies away. Because no matter how much they annoy me and piss me off, they’re my babies. I wouldn’t change them for the world; and no women will ever be good enough for them.

      If they could only just learn to freaking piss INSIDE the damn toilet!`,

      blog: `Being a mom brings me so much joy. My son puts a smile on my face everytime I look at him. However, that doesn’t mean I don’t have days that are overwhelming. Sometimes I feel there aren’t enough hours in the day for me to complete all my task. As a working mom it feels as if I have two jobs. It feels as if I clock of one and then immediately clock in to the next one.

      Imagine a baby crying because he wants to be held and your food is on the stove and if you don’t tend to it dinner will be ruined leaving you with double the work but you don’t want to leave your baby crying. That’s just one scenario of the million I come across as a mother . Being a working mom means I have less time for chores, spending time with my baby, school work, and personal life. As a new mom
      I don’t want anyone thinking I can’t take care of my child so it’s challenging because it makes me never want to ask or accept help.

      There isn’t a cookie cutter way to parent and manage my day to day life. I wake up everyday and tackle that day the best I can that given day.

      I’d say some days I feel like superwoman and other days I feel like I need to do better. `,
