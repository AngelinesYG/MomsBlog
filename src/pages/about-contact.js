             <h4>I am a mother to four amazing boys, who is filled with a passion for writing and creativity. My strength lies in my ability to problem solve with a keen attention to detail. These are qualities that support my work as a Developer.

              My resilient and steadfast attitude makes me a strong woman who will not give up easily. Aside from my love for developing useful apps, I enjoy spending time with my children, listening to the calming sound of waves and rain drops, and a good family movie every now and then.</h4>
